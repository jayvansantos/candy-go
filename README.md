# Candy on Go

Deploy [Candy](http://candy-chat.github.com/candy/) as a [Go](http://golang.org) application.

## Setup

* Check out the submodules: `git submodule update --init`
* Copy `config.json.sample` to `config.json`
* Change the preferences in `config.json` to fit your setup (http://candy-chat.github.io/candy/#configuration)
* Run it with `make`

*Note: As this is my first project in Go, I'd be glad to get responses from more experienced developers.*
